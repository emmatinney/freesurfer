#make sure you have loaded the right free surfer module

 module load freesurfer/6.0.6 (or whichever is newest) 

1. create new dir where all recon-all output dirs are for each subject

 cd /work/cnelab
 mkdir <studyname_FS>


2. copy fsaverage temaplte to study dir 

 cp -R $FREESURFER_HOME/subjects/fsaverage . 

3. define sub dir 

 export SUBJECTS_DIR=`pwd` 
 or 
 setenv SUBJECTS_DIR `pwd` if in tcsh (on cluster it is the former)

4. Create FSGH and Contrasts dirs within study dir: 

 mkdir FSGD Contrasts 

5. Create fsgd file in excel with correct study data - see example .FSGD in /work/cnelab/code/freesurfer and in andysbrainbook and save as .txt

6. upload .txt fsgd file to FSGD dir

7. Convert .txt file to .fsgd format

 tr '\r' '\n' < name.txt > name.fsgd 

8. Navigate to Contrast dir and create contrast file- see examples in andybrainbook and here are some common ones  

 # to regress a single continuous variable (1st var in .fsgd file) while controlling for 5 covariates (following 4 continuous vars in .fsgd file) with all vertices in brain mask crate contrast file with the following: 

 echo "0 1 0 0 0 0 0" > 1group1var5covars.mtx . first 0 indicates group mean (intercept). See third link at top of readme file (line 7) for other examples

 # to create a two group by continuous variable interaction (e.g., differential effect of age on brain structure in males vs females) with 4 covariates:

 echo "0 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0" > 2group1var4covarsall.mtx 

9. Switch shell to tcsh

 tcsh 

10. Navigate to main FS dir

11. Run preprocessing script 

 tcsh runMRIsPreproc.sh studyname       note study name is same as FSGD file 

12. Run GLM fit script 

 tcsh runGLMs.sh studyname       	note study name is same as FSGD file- ensure Contrasts .mtx file is correct for that GLM

13. Run cluster correction script

 tcsh runClustSims.sh studyname   	note study name is same as FSGD file. Ensure -cache is at 3.0 (p<0.001). 

NOTES:

There are several options within the .sh files that need to be discussed with the PI and will be dictated based on several factors. For instance, using the --cache option must use value of 3.0 to have a vertex wise threshold of 0.001. r, if -qcache was not flagged during recon all, these cached thresholds wont exist in each subjects fee surfer folders and you will need to use Montecarlo simulations to create vertex-wise thresholds- to do this use the following script:
 
 tcsh runClustmczsims.sh

More info on cluster and vertex wise corrections can be found tuning the following command: 

 mri_glmfit-sim --help

14. View the results. Navigate to the folders that have been created based on all the input you've done (e.g., lh.thickness.fsgdfilename.10.glmdir) 

Here you should see a file with the same pathname with a .summary extension. At the bottom of that file will be any clusters deemed to be statistically significant. 
rh.thickness.adni.10.glmdir/2group2covar/cache.th30.pos.y.ocn.dat

15. Visualize the results using Freeview 

 freeview -f $SUBJECTS_DIR/fsaverage/surf/rh.inflated:overlay=cache.th13.pos.sig.cluster.mgh
